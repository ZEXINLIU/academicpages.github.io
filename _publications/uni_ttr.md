In this paper, We survey and review existing approaches for comput- ing these recurrence coefficients for univariate orthogonal polynomial families and propose a novel “predictor-corrector” algorithm for a general class of continuous measures. We com- bine the predictor-corrector scheme with a stabilized Lanczos procedure for a new hybrid algorithm that computes recurrence coefficients for a fairly wide class of measures that can have both continuous and discrete parts. We evaluate the new algorithms against existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
