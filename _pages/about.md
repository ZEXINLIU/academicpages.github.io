I am a fourth-year PhD Student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Utah.
I am also a member of Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, working with [Dr. Akil Narayan](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~akil/).
I am interested scientific computing, numerical analysis and uncertainty quantification. More information about me can be found in my [CV](http://zexinliu.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

I am currently contributing to UncertainSCI, collaborating with Computational Electrocardiology Group (CEG) leading by [Dr. Rob MacLeod](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~macleod/). 
UncertainSCI is a Python-based toolkit that harnesses modern techniques to estimate model and parametric uncertainty,
with a particular emphasis on needs for biomedical simulations and applications.
This toolkit enables non-intrusive integration of these techniques with well-established biomedical simulation software.
