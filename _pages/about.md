I am a fourth-year PhD Student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Utah.
I am also a member of Scientific Computing and Imaging (SCI) Institute, working with [Dr. Akil Narayan](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~akil/).
I am interested scientific computing, numerical analysis and uncertainty quantification. More information about me can be found in my [CV](http://zexinliu.github.io/files/CV.pdf).

I am currently contributing to UncertainSCI [(Webpage)](https://www.sci.utah.edu/cibc-software/uncertainsci.html) [(Github)](https://github.com/SCIInstitute/UncertainSCI)
collaborating with Computational Electrocardiology Group (CEG) leading by [Dr. Rob MacLeod](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~macleod/).
UncertainSCI is a Python-based toolkit that harnesses modern techniques to estimate model and parametric uncertainty,
with a particular emphasis on needs for biomedical simulations and applications.
This toolkit enables non-intrusive integration of these techniques with well-established biomedical simulation software.
My contribution is involving but not limited to: PCE setup for models, generation of anisotropic distributions, basis functions of orthgonal polynomials.

Some examples regarding cardiac simulations using UncertainSCI are given here: A sensitivity analysis on variability in heart position on torso potentials(top);
Effect of the heart position on torso surface potentials(bottom).
